## :interrobang: The Challenge

This is one of the challenges designed by Frontend Mentor in order to train and test my skills and knowledge using HTML and CSS. ðŸ”¥ðŸš€

This project is a perfume purchase card.

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## :confetti_ball: Preview:

## :paperclip: Links:

- Solution URL: https://www.frontendmentor.io/solutions/responsive-product-preview-card-component-HaCR4SoeDY
- Live Site URL: https://perfume-preview-card.ianramos.dev/

## :rocket: Built with:

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

## :gem: What I learned:

- This project was very simple, but I learned how to change images dynamically using only CSS, through the background-image property. Depending on the size of the user's screen, the image is changed to another one that makes more sense for that screen.
- I learned that using hsl() to define a color is more interesting if you need to change the color of that button to lighter/darker without having to look for the hexadecimal of that respective color.

## :confetti_ball: How to contribute:

- Make a fork;
- Create a branch with your functionality: `git checkout -b <your_feature_name>`;
- Submit the changes made: `git commit -am 'type(scope): <description>'`;
- Push your branch: `git push origin <your_branch_name>`.

After your request is accepted and added to the project, you can delete your branch.
